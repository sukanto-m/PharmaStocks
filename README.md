This is a project to track stock price movements of two companies - Moderna and Gilead - during the pandemic. Moderna is involved in one of the earliest attempts to develop a coronavirus vaccine while Gilead has been attempting to use the drug remdesevir for coronavirus treatment. The dashboard is elementary and was more of an experiment towards my abilities to develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly, Dash and Flask. The app can be visited at https://pharma-stocks-app.herokuapp.com/.
